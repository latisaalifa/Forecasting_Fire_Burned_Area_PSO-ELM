# Forecasting Fire Burned Area Using Particle Swarm Optimization Extreme Machine Learning (PSO-ELM) 
This repository contains the **scripts and workflow** for my thesis project on **Forecasting Fire Burned Area Using Particle Swarm Optimization Extreme Machine Learning (PSO-ELM)**.  
> Note: The original dataset is confidential and cannot be shared. This repo focuses on the methodology and model implementation.
## Tools & SKill
- `Python (Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, etc`
- `Excel`
- `drawio`
- `Machine Learning and Optimization`
## Project Highlights
- Implemented PSO to optimize ELM model
- Demonstrated preprocessing, training, testingand evaluation workflow
- Predicting using testing Model (Annual)
- Visualized model performance
- Article already published: [Article Publication](https://doi.org/10.33005/senada.v5i1.481)
